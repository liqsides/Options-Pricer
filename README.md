# Options-Pricer
An options GUI that takes stock ticker, strike and expiry and returns theoretical option price via Black Scholes (UNFINISHED)

## WARNING
This pricer is not fully reliable, and it has been some time since I have played with this project at all. If you compile this to an executable, please take the prices this algo returns with a grain of salt. I also believe this was a fork of someone elses repository when I was learning, so credit to the original developer, please contact me if this looks similar to yours and I will credit you.
